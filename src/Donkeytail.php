         * Craft::trace(): record a message to trace how a piece of code runs. This is mainly for development use.
         * Craft::info(): record a message that conveys some useful information.
         * Craft::warning(): record a warning message that indicates something unexpected has happened.
         * Craft::error(): record a fatal error that should be investigated as soon as possible.
         *
         * Unless `devMode` is on, only Craft::warning() & Craft::error() will log to `craft/storage/logs/web.log`
